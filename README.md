# Sales-Analysis

Introduction:

In this Notebook, we are analyzing the 12 months worth of sales data of an electronics store, to get some useful business insights about the Sales and market trend. Each month purchase data in a separate CSV file.
I have below combined these files for annual analysis and have performed some data cleaning for better analysis.

I will be answering below give five questions using the analysis:

Q1: In which month did we had the best sale? How much was earned that month?
Q2 : Which city has the highest number of Sales ?
Q3 : How was the sales trend over the year? When are the customers more likely to make a purchase?
Q4 : What products are most often sold together?
Q5 : What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
